    - shows the duplicates that needed to be cleaned by dropping
        descriptive columns
    remaining_duplicate_date_time_vehicle.png
    - shows duplicates handeled by averaging disparate readings

    - shows that holidays weren't applied to every hour of a day
        that was a holidays

    Feature selection and engineering:
        holiday_pedestrian_traffic_chart.png
        - shows each holiday has different effect on traffic,
            so they should not be grouped into 'holiday' or 'none'
        weekdays_pedestrian_chart.png
        - shows traffic fairly even over all weekdays, different on weekend,
            so should be grouped into 'weekday' and 'weekend'
