## Dashboard
For our final Dashboard, we will use visualizations created with Seaborn and Tableau. Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib and will be used to explore the data. Data exploration will involve identifying outliers, initial patterns in the data, and identifying what variables are useful or if they just create noise for the learning model. An example of using visualizations to identify outliers can be seen below.

Tableau is a visual analytics platform that will allow us to import are final dataset and create more vibrant and complex visualizations. In Tableau we will create several interactive bar charts, line charts and scatter plots.
The interactive elements that will be used in Tableau include the ability to filter pedestrian and vehicle traffic volume by year, month, and holidays. A screen shot of those features can be seen below.
