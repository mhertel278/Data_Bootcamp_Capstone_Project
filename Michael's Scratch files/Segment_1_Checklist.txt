        Column Names, data types__
    Draft Machine Learning Model connected _(make sure machine learning connects to correct files)

Keeping Main clean:

    Files for submission (provisional database files, machine learning script, technology.md) are clearly named and easy to find __
        Double check that Column names/Table layouts match those chosen in ERD, Provisional Database files, Machine Learning read in __ before merging
    
    Any draft files, scratch work, duplicates of data sources, are in 'Scratch' folder to avoid clutter __
    
    Make sure you have at least 4 commits before merging  
    
    Check the rubric to make sure all tasks for your branch are completed and addressed before merging
    
    When ready to merge, create pull request, comment with tasks you did on your branch, files created, expected

        then we all get pull Main to be up to date with end of segment before creating next branch.
    
    Everyone submits link to their segment 1 Github branch to show their commit history after merging.
