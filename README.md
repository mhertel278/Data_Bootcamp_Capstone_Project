# Data_Bootcamp_Capstone_Project
Capstone project for UT Austin Data Bootcamp group 2

## Selected Topic:
We chose to analyze car, pedestrian, and bike traffic data collected in Ramsey County Minnesota from June 2015 to September 2018. 

## Reason for Selected Topic:
We are interested in  how weather, day of the week, time of year and holidays affected commutersâ€™ preferred method of transportation. 

## Source of Data
Our car, pedestrian and bike data came from the Minnesota Department of Transportation. 
Our weather data came from OpenWeatherMap. 
The original datasets can be found at the links below:

https://www.dot.state.mn.us/bike-ped-counting/reports.html

Although these datasets are structured files, they still contain messy and non-benefical characteristics. We will use a linear regression machine learning model to effectively detect relationships between information contained the two datasets. 

## Technologies Used
Our team will use the following technologies and processes listed in the technologies.md to conduct our machine learning project. 

## Questions We Hope to Answer
- How does commuter behavior change given the day of the week and time of year? 
- How do weather conditions affect commuter behavior? 
- Can we predict non-vehicle (bikers + walkers) traffic on a given day assuming vehicle traffic and weather conditions?

## Machine Learning Model
# Preliminary Data Preprocessing 

After our database was connected to our machine learning model, several steps were taken to preprocess the data. In order to make the dataset more compatible with the model, we dropped the date column, as it only contained unique values.  We also dropped a row that contained an extreme outlier.  We scaled the data, and ran the machine learning model with both scaled and unscaled data. We discovered that scaling our data did not make any difference to the accuracy score in this model. 

# Preliminary Feature Engineering and Selection

As we continue to refine our model, we will experiment with the following selection methods: drop holiday columns, drop vehicle columns. For feature engineering, we will experiment with putting the rows into bins of weeks of the year, months and holidays. We will also test the model by adding a day of the week column to the dataset. We will use all of these methods to try to improve the accuracy of the model. 

# Train-Test-Split

To test the accuracy of our machine learning model, we separated our dataset into a training set and a testing set. We trained the model on the training set, which allowed the model to understand the correlation between the data points. Then we ran our testing set through the model, and asked the model to predict the number of non-vehicle commuters. Our model was able to predict the number of non-vehicle commuters with about 70% accuracy. 

# Model Choice

We decided to use linear regression for our machine learning model. Linear regression works well in this scenario because we are attempting to predict the number of non-vehicle commuters on a given day (our target variable). This number is a continuous variable, which is what linear regression models predict. A limitation of a linear regression model is that it can only predict continuous variables. It cannot predict discreet values like a classification machine learning model. Another limitation of linear regression models is that they are especially sensitive to outliers. As stated above, we dropped our extreme outlier in order to make the model more accurate. 

## Dashboard
For our final Dashboard, we will use visualizations created with MatPlotLib and Tableau. 

Our interactive element will consist of allowing the viewer to filter the traffic data by season, weekend or weekday. 

## Communication Protocols
Our team is utilizing Slack as our primary communication platform. Zoom calls are made as needed to discuss topics and project direction. All code is shared through a common GitHub repository.
