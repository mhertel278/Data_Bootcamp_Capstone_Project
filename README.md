# Data_Bootcamp_Capstone_Project
Capstone project for UT Austin Data Bootcamp group 2

## Selected Topic:
Predict bike traffic based on weather and vehicle traffic.

## Reason for Selected Topic:
The purpose of this analysis is to discover bike traffic patterns and trends on any given day in Minnesota. We aim to visualize the effects weather and day of the week have on bike and traffic volumes through utilization of deep learning and neural networks.

## Source of Data
To begin our begin our machine learning project, our team select two datasets: 
- Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv
- 2014-2020_AllUserData_4Website.xlsx 

Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv is from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository website:
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume#

Next, we selected the 2014-2020_AllUserData_4Website.xlsx from the Minnesota Department of Transporation (MnDoT):
    https://www.dot.state.mn.us/bike-ped-counting/reports.html

Although both datasets are structured files, they still contain messy and non-benefical characteristics. We will use neural networks to effectively detect complex nonlinear relationships between the two datasets to answer our questions. Our team will use the following technologies and processes listed in the technologies.md to conduct our machine learning project. 

### Machine Learning Model
Both Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv and 2014-2020_AllUserData_4Website.xlsx files will represent the database to connect to the Vandivort_segment_machine_learning.ipynb, which is our Machine Learning model.

### Provisional Database
To establish the Provisional Database, our team utilized and tranformed our orginial .xlsx file into the biking_provisional_db.xlsx. The biking_provisional_db.xlsx will represent our project's future database structure.

## Communication Protocols
Our team is utilizing Slack as our primary communication platform. Zoom calls are made as needed to discuss topics and project direction.

## Questions We Hope to Answer with the Data
How does the weather and traffic volume effect the amount of bikers on a given day? Will there be an increase in bike traffic if the weather is sunny and low traffic volume? If there is an influx of vehicle traffic on a cloudy day, what will the bike traffic be? 

This are just a few questions our team hopes to answer with the data being fed into our machine learning model.
